# TasksApp

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.2.0.
  
**Scenario 1:** In this scenario, create a component, say component1. A user should be able to enter text in the .html template file of the component. The component should print out the user text to console.  

**Scenario 2:** In this scenario, create a component, say component1. A user should be able to enter text in the .html template file of the component. The template should display the text as the user types.  

**Scenario 3:** In this scenario, create two components, say component1 and component2. Component1 is a parent of component2. A user should be able to enter text in the .html template file of component1. The template of component2 should display the text.  

**Scenario 4:** In this scenario, create two components, say component1 and component2. Component1 is a parent of component2. A user should be able to enter text in the .html template file of component2. The template of component1 should display the text.  

**Scenario 5:** In this scenario, create three components, say component1, component2, and component3. Component1 is a parent of component2, and component2 is a parent of component3. A user should be able to enter text in the .html template file of component3. The template of component1 (grandparent) should display the text.  

**Scenario 6:** In this scenario, create three components, say component1, component2, and component3. Component1 is a parent of both component2 and component3. A user should be able to enter text in the .html template file of component2. The template of component3 (sibling) should display the text. 
 
## Development server
